Key Features
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Displays core business metrics (e.g., Total Sales, New Customers, Customer Retention) in a concise, easily readable format.
These KPIs help users quickly assess the performance of their business.

2. Data Visualizations:
The dashboard incorporates interactive charts that represent business data visually:
Line Chart for tracking sales trends over time.
Bar Chart to show the number of new customers gained each month.
These charts are rendered using the Chart.js library, which provides responsive and interactive charts.

3. Filter Mechanism:
The user can apply a filter to display data for specific time periods (e.g., Last Week, Last Month, Last Year).
This feature allows users to drill down into specific data ranges for better analysis.

4. Responsive and Interactive:
The design is responsive, ensuring that the dashboard looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Users can interact with the charts and filters, making the dashboard dynamic and adaptable to their needs.

5. Clean and Minimalistic Design:
The dashboard is designed with a modern, user-friendly interface that emphasizes clarity and ease of use.
The use of soft colors, intuitive layout, and concise text ensures that the dashboard is visually appealing and straightforward.

Possible Extensions and Improvements
1. Backend Integration:
The dashboard can be extended to fetch live data from a backend server (e.g., using APIs or databases), allowing the metrics and charts to update dynamically based on real-time data.

2. User Authentication:
Adding login functionality to restrict access to the dashboard based on user roles. For example, managers could have access to higher-level insights, while other users only see basic data.
